CHAPTER 11

 ACCESSIBILITY

User note:

About this chapter: Chapter 11 contains provisions that set forth requirements for accessibility of buildings and their associated sites and
facilities for people with physical disabilities. The fundamental  philosophy of the code  on the subject of accessibility  is that everything is
required to be accessible. This is reflected in the basic applicability requirement (see Section 1103.1). The code’s scoping requirements
then address the conditions under which accessibility is not required in terms of exceptions to this general mandate. While the IBC contains
scoping provisions for accessibility (for example, what, where and how many), ICC A117.1, Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities,
is the referenced standard for the technical provisions (in other words, how). Accessibility criteria for existing buildings are addressed in the
International Existing Building Code®. The International Residential Code® references Chapter 11 for accessibility provisions; therefore, this
chapter may be applicable to housing covered under the International Residential Code. The provisions in the I-Codes are intended to meet
or exceed the requirements in the federal accessibility requirement found in the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act.

There are many accessibility issues that not only benefit people with disabilities, but also provide a tangible benefit to people without disabil-
ities.  This  type  of  requirement  can  be  set  forth  in  the  code  as  generally  applicable  without  necessarily  identifying  it  specifically  as  an
accessibility-related issue. Such a requirement would then be considered as having been “mainstreamed.” For example, visible alarms are
located in Chapter 9 and accessible means of egress and ramp requirements are addressed in Chapter 10.
