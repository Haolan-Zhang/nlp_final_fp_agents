### `agents.py`
- Main script for the floor plan revision pipeline.
- Implements three core agents:
  - **Code Searcher Agent** â€“ retrieves relevant building code sections.
  - **Code Examiner Agent** â€“ evaluates the floor plan against the retrieved code.
  - **Lead Designer Agent** â€“ generates an adjustment plan to revise the floor plan toward compliance.

### `qa.py`
- Contains curated QA datasets for evaluating retrieval and reasoning accuracy.
- Includes both expert-level and paraphrased amateur-level accessibility questions.
